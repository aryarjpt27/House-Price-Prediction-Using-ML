# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
In this project a dataset of a no. of houses with multiple features was taken. Firstly, data cleansing was done in which missing values were imputed and outliers were handled. Secondly, categorical features were converted to numerical features in order to be processed by the machine learning model. Then, data was split into test data and train data. Various regression models were trained using the train dataset and the model giving the highest score (random forest regressor and gradient boosting regressor) was selected for making prediction on the test dataset.
